# AgentMind: Technical Whitepaper

## Overview

AgentMind is a modular cognitive framework designed to simulate interpretable and adaptive artificial agents. Each component in AgentMind models a distinct cognitive function inspired by principles from neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive systems design. Modules operate as cooperating subsystems that process input, transform memory, regulate action, and adapt to feedback.

---

## Core Design Principles

1. **Modularity**

   * Each cognitive function is implemented as an independent, pluggable module with a standard interface.
   * Modules can be selectively enabled, replaced, or tuned.

2. **Interpretability**

   * All decisions are traceable to module-level outputs and thresholds.
   * Agent behavior is explainable at each simulation step.

3. **Adaptivity**

   * Each module can learn via reinforcement, supervised, or unsupervised signals.
   * Learning dynamics can be local (within a module) or global (via metacognitive feedback).

4. **Temporal Coherence**

   * Agent state evolves continuously over time.
   * Memory, context, and decisions are temporally indexed and influence each other.

## Agent Architecture

### 1. Cognitive Modules (Detailed)

Each module implements a standard interface:

* `observe(input_data)` → transformed input
* `process(context)` → intermediate cognitive output
* `learn(feedback)` → internal weight or threshold update
* `reset()` → clears internal state if needed

**Attention Control**

* Filters perceptual input based on salience.
* Maintains a threshold value adjusted by a learning rate.
* Implements a prioritization mechanism for multi-feature inputs.
* Optionally: uses a learned attention map (MLP or softmax layer).

Implementation Notes:
- Use a gating mechanism with sigmoid activation for salience filtering
- Implement threshold as a learnable parameter with gradient descent
- Consider using scaled dot-product attention for multi-feature prioritization
- For attention maps, use a 2-layer MLP with ReLU activation

**Working Memory**

* Stores recent perceptual or reasoning results.
* Implements a fixed-size buffer with temporal decay or LRU-like update.
* Supports context embedding and dynamic prioritization.
* Learns retention policies via reward-based salience boosting.

Implementation Notes:
- Use a circular buffer with configurable size (default: 1000 items)
- Implement temporal decay using exponential decay function
- Store items as (timestamp, data, priority) tuples
- Use priority queue for dynamic reordering

**Impulse Inhibition**

* Suppresses actions predicted to yield low reward.
* Maintains a threshold policy, optionally trained via Q-learning.
* Tracks context-value-action triads to suppress recurrent impulsive errors.
* Learning signal: negative reward with fast response context.

Implementation Notes:
- Implement Q-learning with epsilon-greedy exploration
- Use a sliding window to track recent context-value-action triads
- Store inhibition history in a priority queue
- Apply softmax normalization to action probabilities

**Cognitive Flexibility**

* Selects or switches between alternate strategies.
* Implements strategy switch confidence, rule network mutation, or behavior trees.
* Responds to declining reward, error patterns, or goal conflicts.
* Learns via meta-policy selection or entropy-based exploration encouragement.

Implementation Notes:
- Use a hierarchical behavior tree for strategy representation
- Implement strategy switching using confidence thresholds
- Track strategy performance with exponential moving average
- Use entropy regularization for exploration

**Emotional Regulation**

* Modulates internal activation levels to prevent erratic decision shifts.
* Implements a dampening system over short-term volatility.
* Can simulate fatigue, frustration, or risk aversion by altering other module thresholds.
* Learns affective tuning curves through meta-adaptive reward history.

Implementation Notes:
- Use PID controller for activation level modulation
- Implement dampening using exponential moving average
- Store emotional state as a vector of activation levels
- Use reinforcement learning for threshold tuning

**Pattern Recognition**

* Clusters, classifies, or segments input patterns.
* May use K-means, CNNs, or unsupervised embeddings (e.g., VAEs).
* Provides compressed representations or context tags.
* Learning goal: minimize intra-cluster distance while maximizing reward predictiveness.

Implementation Notes:
- Implement K-means with dynamic cluster number
- Use VAE for unsupervised feature learning
- Store pattern templates in a vector database
- Apply cosine similarity for pattern matching

**Long-Term Memory**

* Persistent key-value store with optional embedding support.
* Supports episodic tagging, context-frequency indexing, or vector-based similarity search.
* Learns access frequency, decay scheduling, or semantic grouping heuristics.
* May integrate with vector databases or trainable memory encoders.

Implementation Notes:
- Use FAISS for efficient vector similarity search
- Implement memory decay using power-law forgetting curve
- Store memories as (key, value, metadata, embedding) tuples
- Use BERT or similar for semantic encoding

**Abstract Reasoning**

* Performs symbolic inference or simulation.
* Maintains a rule base, inference graph, or learned symbolic embeddings.
* Can support multi-hop analogical chaining or conditional planning.
* Learns through self-supervised prediction error or rule induction feedback.

Implementation Notes:
- Use graph neural networks for symbolic reasoning
- Implement rule base as a directed graph
- Store inference chains in a tree structure
- Use transformer architecture for analogical reasoning

**Goal Maintenance**

* Tracks persistent objectives and alignment scores.
* Implements temporal value traces and discounting curves.
* Can override or delay immediate action in favor of distant reward maximization.
* Learns via exponential reward averaging and milestone tracking.

Implementation Notes:
- Use temporal difference learning for value estimation
- Implement discounting using hyperbolic discount function
- Store goals as (priority, deadline, reward) tuples
- Use priority queue for goal scheduling

**Metacognition**

* Monitors success rate, confidence, and module divergence.
* Maintains logs of decision quality and policy adaptation.
* Can adjust other module thresholds, switch rules, or initiate resets.
* Learns through confidence error prediction and dynamic threshold tuning.

Implementation Notes:
- Use Bayesian inference for confidence estimation
- Implement module monitoring using statistical tests
- Store decision logs in a time-series database
- Use gradient-based optimization for threshold tuning

### 2. Agent Core

* Manages execution loop and inter-module communication.
* Provides centralized logging, memory access, and decision resolution.
* Implements a final `select_action()` method combining reasoning, inhibition, and willpower outputs.

---

## Learning Framework

Each module defines:

* A **learning objective** (e.g., maximize reward, reduce error, stabilize threshold)
* A **signal source** (external reward, prediction error, module conflict)
* An **update rule** (simple rules, supervised learning, RL policies)

Sample Update:

```python
if reward < 0.5:
    inhibition_threshold += 0.05
else:
    inhibition_threshold -= 0.05
```

Modules can log metadata for post-run diagnostics and be plugged into external optimization loops.

---

## Simulation Workflow

1. **Perceive** → `agent.observe()` ingests environment data.
2. **Process** → modules generate intermediate cognitive responses.
3. **Decide** → Agent core resolves action from competing module signals.
4. **Act** → Action is executed in environment.
5. **Learn** → Feedback passed to modules for tuning.
6. **Log** → State snapshot recorded for evaluation.

---

## Configuration and Extensibility

* Module parameters defined in `config.yaml` or similar.
* Each module declares introspectable `state` and `schema`.
* Extensions may include:

  * Custom modules
  * Hardware-accelerated neural engines
  * Inter-agent communication systems

---

## Applications

* Modular RL experiments
* Human-aligned agent architectures
* Simulated cognition research
* Interpretability and transparency tooling

---

## Future Directions

* Dynamic module evolution during runtime
* Agent self-modification and architecture search
* Interoperable graph of cognitive function reuse
* Integration with language agents, planning modules, or vision pipelines

---

## Summary

AgentMind provides a detailed framework for interpretable, modular cognition. Each component is designed to be independently understandable, modifiable, and trainable—enabling richer studies of adaptive intelligence and the emergence of coherent, goal-driven behavior from distributed cognitive function.
