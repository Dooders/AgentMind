## üß† Neuroscience

### **1. Michael Gazzaniga**

* **Core Theory**: Modular Mind / Split-Brain Studies
* **Notable Works**:

  * *The Ethical Brain* (2005)
  * *Who's in Charge? Free Will and the Science of the Brain* (2011)
* **Key Idea**: The human brain consists of specialized, semi-autonomous regions responsible for distinct tasks. Gazzaniga's work on split-brain patients showed how separate hemispheres could exhibit independent processing and conflicting interpretations.
* **AgentMind Influence**: Justifies cognitive compartmentalization. Modules can act semi-independently yet contribute to coherent behavior, with integration at a central workspace.

### **2. Stanislas Dehaene**

* **Core Theory**: Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW)
* **Notable Works**:

  * *Consciousness and the Brain* (2014)
  * *The Number Sense* (1997)
* **Key Idea**: Consciousness arises when specific information is globally broadcast across a ‚Äúworkspace‚Äù involving prefrontal and parietal cortex. Unconscious modules process in parallel and compete for access to this global stage.
* **AgentMind Influence**: Inspired the **Cognitive Core**‚Äîa central component where selected context is shared across modules. Also motivates attention gating and the notion of limited representational bandwidth.

### **3. Bernard Baars**

* **Core Theory**: Global Workspace Theory (GWT)
* **Notable Works**:

  * *A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness* (1988)
  * Later co-developed extensions like the Global Workspace Dynamics (GWD)
* **Key Idea**: Conscious cognition is the result of broadcasting to a shared stage where information becomes globally available. The brain contains many unconscious specialists which feed into this workspace.
* **AgentMind Influence**: Reinforces AgentMind‚Äôs use of **attention filtering**, **competitive broadcast**, and **modular unconscious subsystems**. Influences memory integration and action selection based on globally relevant inputs.

## üß† Psychology

### **4. Daniel Kahneman**

* **Core Theory**: Dual-Process Theory (System 1 & 2 Thinking)
* **Notable Works**:

  * *Thinking, Fast and Slow* (2011)
  * Nobel Prize in Economics (2002)
* **Key Idea**: Human cognition has two interacting systems: fast, instinctive, automatic processes (System 1), and slow, deliberate, rational processes (System 2).
* **AgentMind Influence**: Leads to the separation of modules like **Pattern Recognition** (System 1) and **Abstract Reasoning** (System 2). Encourages a multi-layered control system balancing speed, intuition, and deliberate thought.

### **5. John R. Anderson**

* **Core Theory**: ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought‚ÄîRational)
* **Notable Works**:

  * *Rules of the Mind* (1993)
  * *How Can the Human Mind Occur in the Physical Universe?* (2007)
* **Key Idea**: Cognition consists of declarative memory (facts) and procedural memory (rules), governed by production systems. Modules interact through a central control structure.
* **AgentMind Influence**: Informs the design of **Working Memory**, **Long-Term Memory**, and **Goal Maintenance** modules. The idea of slot-filling and production rules influences symbolic inference and control flow.

### **6. Jean Piaget**

* **Core Theory**: Stages of Cognitive Development
* **Notable Works**:

  * *The Language and Thought of the Child* (1923)
  * *The Origins of Intelligence in Children* (1952)
* **Key Idea**: Cognition develops in stages‚Äîsensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational‚Äîthrough interaction, assimilation, and accommodation.
* **AgentMind Influence**: Inspires the **Cognitive Flexibility** module. Suggests that reasoning ability and strategy-switching should be contextually gated and progressively enhanced. Also informs ideas around developmental AI and scaffolding.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Systems Design & AI

### **7. David Marr**

* **Core Theory**: Levels of Analysis
* **Notable Works**:

  * *Vision: A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information* (1982)
* **Key Idea**: Any cognitive system should be analyzed at three levels:

  1. Computational (What is being solved?)
  2. Algorithmic (How is it solved?)
  3. Implementational (What physically carries it out?)
* **AgentMind Influence**: Promotes clear separation between the goal of each module (e.g., attention), the mechanism (threshold vs. neural), and the implementation (Python class, RNN, etc.). Encourages multi-level modular design.

### **8. Marvin Minsky**

* **Core Theory**: Society of Mind
* **Notable Works**:

  * *The Society of Mind* (1986)
  * *The Emotion Machine* (2006)
* **Key Idea**: Intelligence emerges from the interaction of many small, simple agents (‚Äúresources‚Äù or ‚Äúframes‚Äù) working in cooperation. There is no single central controller.
* **AgentMind Influence**: The philosophical root of AgentMind. Each module is a cognitive agent, and intelligence is the emergent property of their coordination. Influences decentralized design and interpretability.

### **9. Herbert Simon**

* **Core Theory**: Bounded Rationality & Decision-Making
* **Notable Works**:

  * *Administrative Behavior* (1947)
  * *The Sciences of the Artificial* (1969)
* **Key Idea**: Human decision-making is bounded by cognitive limitations and available information. We satisfice (seek ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù) rather than optimize.
* **AgentMind Influence**: Encourages practical, heuristic reasoning modules. Validates the use of interpretable, rule-based control systems over opaque black-box optimization. Reinforces adaptive thresholds, reward-adjusted confidence, and self-regulation.
