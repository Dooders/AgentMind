**AgentMind: A Modular Framework for Modeling Cognitive Function**

**Abstract**
AgentMind is a computational framework that models intelligent agent cognition using a modular structure. Each module represents a distinct cognitive function that influences perception, memory, behavior, and decision-making. Inspired by neuroscience (Gazzaniga, Dehaene, Baars), psychology (Kahneman, Anderson, Piaget), and systems design (Marr, Minsky, Simon), AgentMind provides a composable architecture for simulating adaptive, reflective, and goal-oriented behavior in artificial agents.

**1. Introduction**
Modern artificial intelligence systems benefit from modularity, interpretability, and adaptability. However, few frameworks provide a cognitively grounded foundation for modeling intelligence in a way that mirrors human psychological structures. AgentMind addresses this gap by structuring intelligent behavior around discrete cognitive subsystems—modular components that perform distinct roles and can be adapted or emphasized depending on context, experience, or design goals.

**2. Cognitive Module Overview**
Each module represents a cognitive function implemented as a pluggable, trainable component:

* **Attention Control**: Directs focus and filters distractions. It determines which stimuli the agent attends to and which it ignores, affecting data intake and processing efficiency. Strong attention control ensures sustained concentration and task relevance, especially in complex or noisy environments. In practice, this module interacts with perceptual inputs and gating mechanisms to regulate bandwidth and resource allocation within the cognitive system.

* **Working Memory**: Holds and manipulates short-term information. This module functions as the agent’s mental workspace, enabling it to retain task-relevant data, process intermediate results, and integrate real-time updates during cognitive operations. It serves as a buffer between perception and action and is crucial for multi-step reasoning, language comprehension, and temporary goal tracking.

* **Impulse Inhibition**: Prevents immediate, unfiltered responses. It evaluates potential actions against goals and constraints, suppressing those that may be counterproductive. This module is essential for aligning behavior with internal policies and long-term planning. It is tightly integrated with emotional regulation and goal maintenance, helping prevent reactionary or destructive behaviors.

* **Cognitive Flexibility**: Enables adaptive thinking. It allows the agent to switch strategies, reinterpret input, and shift between contexts. This module supports problem-solving in dynamic environments and prevents cognitive rigidity. It plays a key role in innovation, error recovery, and maintaining coherence when encountering conflicting information or sudden changes.

* **Emotional Regulation**: Modulates affective states and their impact on decision-making. It helps balance reactions to inputs, manage stress responses, and adapt affective biases based on goals. In humanlike agents, this module allows for socially aware and resilient behavior. It integrates with perception, memory, and reasoning to modulate state transitions and behavioral thresholds.

* **Pattern Recognition**: Detects structures and regularities in data. This module underpins generalization, abstraction, and efficient learning. It empowers agents to form predictive models and recognize novel but similar configurations based on experience. It operates across sensory modalities and symbolic domains, enabling both low-level recognition and high-level analogical mapping.

* **Long-Term Memory**: Stores durable knowledge and experiences. It allows the agent to recall learned strategies, past outcomes, and contextual knowledge, making learning cumulative and behavior increasingly informed over time. This module incorporates episodic and semantic memory and interfaces with working memory for contextual reasoning.

* **Metacognition**: Monitors and regulates internal processes. This module enables self-awareness, performance evaluation, and strategic adaptation. It informs the agent when to shift tactics, ask for help, or revise assumptions. Metacognition enables model introspection, uncertainty quantification, and memory auditing, supporting agent-level trust and interpretability.

* **Abstract Reasoning**: Engages with symbolic and conceptual relationships. It supports analogy, mathematical inference, and high-level planning. This module is crucial for agents operating in complex or symbolic domains such as science, language, or ethics. It allows agents to operate over internal models, simulate outcomes, and construct formal arguments.

* **Goal Maintenance**: Maintains persistent goal-directed behavior. This module integrates long-term objectives with moment-to-moment decisions, ensuring consistency, delaying gratification, and managing motivational energy. It plays a central role in agent identity, task persistence, and alignment with external constraints and internal aspirations.

**3. Architecture**
AgentMind is composed of interconnected modules that interface with a central agent core managing sensory input, action selection, and memory systems. Each module can:

* Operate independently or collaboratively
* Be adjusted in strength (e.g., through experience, configuration, or evolution)
* Influence and be influenced by other modules

The core architecture consists of:

* **Input Layer**: Perception interface
* **Cognitive Core**: Hosts cognitive function modules
* **Memory System**: Short-term, intermediate, and long-term memory
* **Action Layer**: Behavior output with modulation from cognitive modules

---

**4. Implementation**
AgentMind modules are implemented as pluggable components using standard interfaces. Each module:

* Maintains internal state
* Receives context from the core
* Outputs recommendations or transformations

Neural, symbolic, or hybrid implementations are possible depending on the desired fidelity and purpose. Example: Working Memory may use a recurrent neural network while Impulse Inhibition could be a threshold-based controller.

**5. Use Cases**

* **Cognitive Simulations**: Modeling human decision-making under stress
* **Reinforcement Learning**: Augmenting agents with selective attention or emotional gating
* **Personal AI**: Agents that reflect evolving user goals and emotional states
* **Educational Tools**: Simulations that help students understand cognition

**6. Future Work**
Future versions of AgentMind may include:

* Genetic variation of cognitive module configuration
* Adaptive tuning based on reward feedback
* Integration with simulation engines and natural language models
* Visual interfaces for inspecting cognitive state and interaction dynamics

**7. Inspiration and Foundations**
AgentMind draws on interdisciplinary foundations:

* **Neuroscience**:

  * Michael Gazzaniga – Modular brain theory
  * Stanislas Dehaene – Global neuronal workspace
  * Bernard Baars – Cognitive architecture and consciousness

* **Psychology**:

  * Daniel Kahneman – Dual-process theory
  * John R. Anderson – ACT-R cognitive architecture
  * Jean Piaget – Developmental stages of reasoning and flexibility

* **Systems Design**:

  * David Marr – Levels of analysis in cognitive modeling
  * Marvin Minsky – The Society of Mind
  * Herbert Simon – Bounded rationality and decision systems

These works inform the modular, interpretable, and adaptive goals of the AgentMind framework.

**8. Conclusion**
AgentMind reimagines artificial cognition as a modular, interpretable system grounded in cognitive science. By treating cognitive faculties as structured, interactive systems—adaptive, self-evaluative, and composable—this framework lays the foundation for more humanlike, adaptable, and understandable artificial agents.
